# SimpleTodoList

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.3.

## Specification

- Make an angular app that runs locally and displays an interactive task list.
- The data does not need to persist.
- Have the task list appear in a card, i.e. have some kind of border around it.
- Have a title bar at the top of the card with a dark color and white bold text, with the text saying something like "Task list".
- The list should start out empty, with an input for the user to add a task (which is a simple string of text).
- When a task is added by the user, it is appended to the displayed list.
- Each task also has an icon button to the right for deleting the task.
- Use your best judgment to make margins and layout that look professional and that are responsive to multiple screen sizes.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
